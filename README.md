# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe webpage created to put into practice my HTML knowledge.

The webpage consists of a mainpage with links to three recipes, each consisting of an image of the dish to make, a list of ingredients, and some steps to follow.

With this project I've consolidated my knowledge about lists, images, links and text in HTML.
